# Performance Optimizations & Auto-Refresh Implementation

This document outlines the performance optimizations and auto-refresh mechanisms implemented in the project.

## Optimizations Implemented

### 1. Auto-Refresh Mechanisms

- **Health Monitoring**: Added system health checks that automatically refresh the application when failures are detected.
- **Error Recovery**: Implemented error boundaries to catch and handle errors gracefully.
- **API Health Endpoint**: Enhanced the `/api/health` endpoint to monitor server performance.
- **Memory Monitoring**: Added memory usage tracking to prevent excessive memory consumption.
- **Network Error Detection**: Added network error detection with automatic refresh on critical failures.

### 2. Performance Optimizations

- **Component Memoization**: Used React.memo to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
- **Code Splitting**: Enhanced webpack configuration for better code splitting.
- **Optimized Webpack Config**: Improved build process with better chunk splitting and caching.
- **Memory Management**: Added memory cleanup utilities.
- **Static Asset Optimization**: Improved caching for static assets.

### 3. Memory Usage Optimization

- **Memory Tracking**: Added monitoring of heap size and memory usage.
- **Garbage Collection**: Implemented helper utilities for encouraging garbage collection.
- **Resource Cleanup**: Added cleanup of unused resources when they're no longer in view.
- **Memory Thresholds**: Set thresholds to refresh the application if memory usage becomes too high.

### 4. Network Optimizations

- **Improved Fetch Handling**: Added better error handling for network requests.
- **Connection Monitoring**: Added online/offline status monitoring.
- **Error Recovery**: Implemented automatic retry and refresh when connections fail.

## How to Use

The auto-refresh mechanism works automatically when:

1. API requests fail consecutively (3+ times)
2. Memory usage exceeds safe thresholds
3. Critical JavaScript errors occur
4. Network connectivity issues are detected

## Configuration

You can adjust the threshold values in:

1. `src/lib/health-monitor.ts` - For health check intervals and thresholds
2. `src/components/RouteLoaderProvider.tsx` - For network error thresholds
3. `next.config.js` - For webpack and Next.js optimizations

## Testing

To test the auto-refresh functionality:
1. Temporarily modify the API health endpoint to return errors
2. Simulate network failures using browser dev tools
3. Monitor memory usage in the performance tab

## Maintenance Recommendations

1. **Monitor Memory Usage**: Regularly check the health endpoint for memory trends
2. **Update Dependencies**: Keep dependencies updated for best performance
3. **Code Reviews**: Focus on memory management in code reviews
4. **Testing**: Test the application under load to ensure refresh mechanisms work properly
